Descriptions of bicycle simulations

SHAPING Definitions
0 : no shaping, bicycle gets +1 reward if has not fallen at a state
1: shaping with lean and lean rate. (1-(abs(phi)) - np.sign(phi)*phi_dot/10)


***** SIMULATIONS *****

VI2: Value Iteration 2. 11/7/18. Shaping of 1 - abs(phi) - phi_dot*sign(phi)/10.
    Linear Interpolation to get values for states. 30 episodes of value iteration.
    Grid Discritization of 0.
    Bicycle Balanced for all 10s!!
    Sharpe Jumps in steer angle command. This is to be expected.

VI3: Value Iteration 3. 11/7/18. No shaping (shaping 0)
    Linear Interpolation to get values for states. 30 epsiodes of value iteration.
    Grid Discritization of 0
    Bike balances for ~1.5 seconds.

VI4: Value Iteration 3. 11/7/18. Shaping = 1. No interpolation (to get the value
    of a state, take the value of the nearest state). 30 training episodes.
    Grid Discritization 0.
    Bike balances for 0.68s

VI5: Value Iteration 5. 11/7/18. Shaping = 0 (No shaping). Linear Interpolation.
    100 episodes, Grid Discritization 0.
    Bike Balances for ~1.5s

VI6: Value ITeration 6. 11/7/18. Reward_flag = 1. Linear interpolation.
    state_grid_flag = 1. action_grid_flag = 2

VI7: Value ITeration 7. 11/7/18. Reward_flag = 2. State_grid_flag = 1,
    action_grid_flag = 0.

VI8: Value Iteration. action_flag = 2 (100 actions). State_grid_flag = 0?
    Reward_flag = 1?
